As a UI Front End Developer on the LabGistics team at Revvity, I contributed to the development of a new product within the Signals product suite. This involved leveraging existing React components from the codebase and developing new ones where necessary. I enhanced the product by adding new features and user pathways, ensuring scalability and reusability. I collaborated closely with UX designers to provide feedback, ensuring consistency with existing components and accessibility of interactions. I utilized REST APIs to populate product pages and create/update entities crucial to the product, and I collaborated with backend developers to define API structures. I led the effort to refactor the codebase from JavaScript to TypeScript, defining types for robust API responses and establishing patterns for typing future components and APIs. Additionally, I advocated for semantic and accessible frontend code through PR reviews and knowledge sharing.
