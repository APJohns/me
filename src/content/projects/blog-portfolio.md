My portfolio and blog are fairly straightforward content-driven sites. This made my decision to use Astro an easy one. Astro strips out JavaScript and leaves you with the closest thing to static HTML/CSS I have seen from a framework. Astro also lets you use different frameworks within it, to the point of components of different frameworks on the same page. This makes Astro a really interesting tool for exploring other frameworks without having to commit to converting an entire project. These features among many more improve developer experience, performance, and accessibility. It enabled me to get these sites up and running quickly and easily, which meant I could spend more time focussing on the ui and content.
